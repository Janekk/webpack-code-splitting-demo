# webpack-code-splitting-demo
A demo for Webpack's code splitting feature (blog post: http://janekk.github.io/2016/04/25/load-your-app-faster-with-webpack-code-splitting.html)

## How to run the app

* `npm install` 
* `webpack -p`
* `webpack-dev-server` (_`-p` switch runs it in production mode, minifying the scripts_)
* go to [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/)
